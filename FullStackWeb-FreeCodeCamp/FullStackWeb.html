    <p title="learn about paragraph or p tag in HTML">
        This is a paragraph in HTMl, <br> you can make a new line when you use "br" tag
    </p>
    <hr>

    <pre>
        This is also a paragraph but it created by "pre" tag
        When you "pre" tag you can put whatever you write from code to website
        But it's have some different from "p" tag.
        I don't know how it's just like that
        And you can see a line between a paragraph make by "p" tag and "pre" tag 
        Because i was use "hr" tag, it's will brake the line by a line as you can see
    </pre>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The next part in this course is about formating of elements like Bold, Italic blabla
    <br>But i will not care about it, it will be decided by stylesheet or we say the CSS file    
    </p>

    <p>
        Simlar the previous part this part is about color in HTML
    <br>And it's also decided by CSS file so i don't care about that
    </p>
